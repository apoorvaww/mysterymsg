**Mysterymsg** is a full stack application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and TypeScript. Mysterymsg allows users to create their profile which then creates their unique profile link which users can copy to send anonymous messages. The identity of people sending messages is kept entirely hidden. Another feature is AI Integration with Gemini. Mystermysg includes ai-generated messages with the help of google-2.0-flash model. Throughout the whole project I have used shadcn for sleek UI.

Here's a overview of features:
- Send and receive anonymous messages
- Unique profile links for sharing
- Sender's identity stays hidden
- Authentication in sign-in is done using NextAuth.js
- Custom built sign-up flow
- Built with TypeScript for safety.
- Embedded Gemini AI model to generate/suggest messages.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
